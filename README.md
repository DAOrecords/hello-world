# hello-world

Blessings in disguise come in all shapes and sizes, so in light of our current global situation we are here learning Github and preparing for the launch of our first Gitcoin Grant. If you don't know who we are, now's a good time for us to share!

DAOrecords is our attempt at reinventing the record label, so we can help usher in a more democratic music industry. With that said, we are just launching our DAO - TuneDAO, which aims at providing content creation grants to musicians as well as supporting real-world community initiatives. That means we cycle our streaming revenue and other profits back into the DAO to fund our grants, as we move towards a sustainable future.

There's a whole lot more going on behind the scenes so we invite you to visit our website - https://daorecords.org

One Love!
